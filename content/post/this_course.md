## Why I decided to take this course?

### Well I like to learn something new every day basis. About DevOps it was an idea to see what there is to understand that I hadn't understand yet. These practical assignments are fun to do, whereas the theoretical videos are not as much. I hadn't used Hugo before so it was a fine encounter as well to learn. Seems to be a fast way to make a simple site. Django is a simple framework to build websites as well and it allows more complex outcomes. But Hugo seems to be great for personal portfolios. Was this enough? You can always write me and I am happy to share my eventful life stories :-)

### I'm adding here also a link back to the index page:
