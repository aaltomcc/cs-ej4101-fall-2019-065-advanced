## Hello, this is me. 
### I was born in Hoyvik, Faroe Islands. At the age of ten, I swam across the North Sea to Oslo, Norway. 
On my lenghty journey I decided that I want to become a marine biologist. However dreams never come true, so I became a data scientist instead.
This page has been created, so that I would get acquainted with Travis CI and Hugo. Both of them seems simple enough. So is this story true or not? If you want to believe it, then let's say it is true. 
#### There are so many fancy alternatives to build pages these days. And they keep coming. Django is a fine one to master as well. This might very well be the 100 words already? Let's put a nice picture here as well.
